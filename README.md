I run this locally in Chromium Version 98.0.4695.0 (Developer Build) (32-bit) and on the latest version of mobile Chrome on my android.  On my android I run it from chromes internal storage download folder.
On my phone the url is "file:///storage/emulated/0/Android/data.com.android.chrome/files/Download/GJE/GJE.html"
